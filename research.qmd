From dodging collisions to deciding how much effort to expend on
offspring, behaviour provides a means for animals to respond to diverse
challenges in nature. The goal of our research is to understand the
mechanisms that have evolved to solve sensory, motor, and
decision-making problems. Some of our recent interests:

\> How animals use multiple cues to guide movement and decision-making\
\> The function and origin of movement behaviours\
\> How individual behaviours determine population-level processes

Understanding the mechanistic causes of behavior is necessary to
anticipate and solve many applied problems in ecology. Natural
behavioural systems can also provide inspiration for solving
technological problems (after all, [evolution is cleverer than you
are](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orgel%27s_rules)). Our approach to
animal behaviour often involves gleaning insights from high-throughput
data.

Finally, we also aim to inspire broader interest and participation in
science through our outreach and teaching activities.
