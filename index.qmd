#### **We study animal behaviour, flight, and animal interactions.**

We are located in the [Department of Biology](https://carleton.ca/biology/) at Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada. Research in the lab is led by Dr. Roslyn (Roz) Dakin.

2026: Please get in touch if you would like to discuss potential MSc and PhD positions.

We often have opportunities for undergraduate students to join the lab as an Honours student, summer research assistant, or work study student. Email me and we can meet to discuss possibilities. It is a good idea to get in touch early because positions for Honours students are limited.
