We study animal behaviour, flight, and animal interactions.

We are located in the [Department of Biology](https://carleton.ca/biology/) at Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada. Research in the lab is led by Dr. Roslyn (Roz) Dakin.

**Feb 2026: I am looking for undergraduate students to apply for NSERC USRA and DSRI/BISRI to work with us in the lab this summer.**

**If you are interested in applying, please get in touch.**

[Some info & advice for Carleton undergraduate students re: how to get involved in research here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11KPIETvmIC_t0TYi3qEFWk4AYjYqjlvIAI9nDk8G3E8/edit?usp=sharing)

Each year, I often have opportunities for undergraduate students to join the lab as an Honours student, intern, or work study student. Email me and we can meet to discuss possibilities. It's a good idea to get in touch early because positions are limited.
